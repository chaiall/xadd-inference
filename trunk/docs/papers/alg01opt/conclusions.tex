\subsection{Future Work}
\label{sec:concl.futurework}

Incrementally maintain half-spaces.

Parallelization.

Use subset of points in SLA close to current boundary... other
points unlikely to change from small shift in boundary.

Currently, the first process of the SLA algorithm uses a modified
gradient descent mechanism. However, there are faster optimization
methods that can be used, such as the pseudo-second order
Levenberg-Marquardt method \cite{Marquardt}, or the trust region
Newton's method \cite{Steihaug}.

Boosting?
