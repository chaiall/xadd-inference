%- linear to constant gain in representation for step functions

In this work, we introduced the first bounded approxiximate symbolic
dynamic programming (BASDP) algorithm for HMDPs with continuous
actions and piecewise linear dynamics and rewards.  We achieved this
by proposing a bounded error compression technique for XADDs used in
BASDP that involved the solution of a constrained bilinear saddle
point problem.  We exploited a number of key insights in the structure
of this problem to express it as a bilevel linear programming problem
that could be solved to optimality in finite time via constraint
generation in a linear programming framework, despite having an
apparent infinite set of potential constraints.  Empirically, this
BASDP solution yielded order-of-magnitude speedups over the exact
solution in exchange for a small approximation error hence vastly
increasing the range of HMDPs for which bounded error approximate
solutions are possible.
