% XADD Approximation

- SDP has enabled solution of expressive hybrid MDPs.

- But exact solutions inherently limited.

- Need to approximate within error bounds.

- Motivating example: step, value function, triangle, value function, 
  error bounds.

- But this leads to a bilinear optimization problem.

- Fortuitously, we show that this bilinear optimization can be solved
  in an iterative solution of a bi-level linear programming problem
  where termination with a certificate of optimality occurs long
  before an exponential number of constraints are generated.

- Evaluation shows order-of-magnitude speedups in exchange for
  relatively small approximation error.  Can solve scales of problems
  previously unsolvable.

- First approximate hybrid MDP solution with strict error bounds that
  can be adjusted to an arbitrary level of precision.
