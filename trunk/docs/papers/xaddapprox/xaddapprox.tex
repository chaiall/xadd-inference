\begin{abstract}
Recent advances in symbolic dynamic programming (SDP) have provided
exact solutions for mixed discrete and continuous (hybrid) MDPs with
piecewise linear dynamics and continuous actions. Combined with the
extended algebraic decision diagram (XADD) data structure to compactly
represent functions over discrete and continuous variables,
approximate SDP methods have been able to solve problems such as
multivariate inventory control for which exact solutions were
previously considered intractable. Unfortunately, XADD-based solutions
to these problems can still grow quite large as problem size increases
leading to the natural question of whether XADDs can be approximately
compressed within fixed error bounds. To this end, we propose a
compression technique for linear XADDs that requires the repeated
solution of a bilinear program with an exponential number of
constraints. Fortuitously, we show that this class of bilinear
programs can be rewritten as an iterative bilevel linear programming
problem that mitigates the need to generate an exponential number of
constraints while still guaranteeing optimality. This solution permits
the use of efficient linear program solvers and enables a novel class
of bounded approximate SDP algorithms based on XADD
compression. Empirically, we demonstrate this approach offers
order-of-magnitude speedups over the exact solution for a variety of
hybrid MDPs in exchange for relatively small approximation error.
